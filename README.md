# Regression-Analysis-of-Old-Faithful
This repo analyzes data from Old Faithful geyser using linear regression. Python code with NumPy and Pandas is used to plot data, compute correlation, and predict waiting times for given eruption durations.

old-faithful-analysis.py reads data from the 'faithful.csv' file and generates a scatter plot of the duration of eruptions versus time until the next eruption. It also calculates and outputs the mean times of the two variables. Additionally, the code centers the data by subtracting the mean from each row, and generates a second scatter plot using the centered data. The scatter plots can help identify any patterns or trends in the data, while the mean times provide summary statistics that help describe the central tendencies of the dataset. This code is useful for exploratory data analysis and can be used as a starting point for more complex regression analyses.
